/// Report Confidence (RC) - CVSS v3.1 Temporal Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v3.1 Specification: Section 3.3:
/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#t6>
///
/// > This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the
/// > credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities
/// > is publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as
/// > undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated
/// > by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be
/// > certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgment by the author or
/// > vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a
/// > vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of
/// > technical knowledge available to would-be attackers.
/// >
/// > The more a vulnerability is validated by the vendor or other reputable sources, the higher the score.
