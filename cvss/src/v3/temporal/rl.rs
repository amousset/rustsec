/// Remediation Level (RL) - CVSS v3.1 Temporal Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v3.1 Specification: Section 2.1.2:
/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document#t6>
///
/// > The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The
/// > typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may
/// > offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these
/// > respective stages adjusts the Temporal Score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as
/// > remediation becomes final. The list of possible values is presented in Table 10. The less
/// > official and permanent a fix, the higher the vulnerability score.
